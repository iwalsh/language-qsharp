# Q# language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to Q# files (`.qs`) in Atom.

I've based this mostly on Microsoft's [official description](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quantum-qr-intro?view=qsharp-preview) of the language, as well as playing around with the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.DevKit) Visual Studio extension. I've also benefitted greatly from studying the preexisting [C# language package](https://github.com/atom/language-csharp).

Contributions and feedback are welcome - feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue, respectively.
